    <p>
      <?= SITE_NAME ?> has no advertisements, is not sponsored, and
      provides its services free of charge.
      For these reasons, its main income source is voluntary user donations.
      Supporting <?= SITE_NAME ?> is and will always remain
      voluntary.
      If you're financially able, please help pay its bills by donating.
      We use the donations to cover the costs of running the site, tracker, and IRC network.
    </p>

    <p>
      No staff member or other individual responsible for the site's operation personally profits from user donations.
      As a donor, your financial support is exclusively applied to operating costs.
      By donating to <?= SITE_NAME ?>, you're helping to defray the
      recurring costs of necessary information services.
    </p>

    <p>
      <?= SITE_NAME ?> currently operates on a shoestring budget.
      The costs of running the site, and all its technical and legal infrastructure, are minimal by design.
      Keeping costs in a range that I can pay out of pocket helps ensure the site doesn't depend on donations to exist.
      Please find a detailed site budget below.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Tracker Server.</strong>
        We currently use one budget VPS at 2.50€ per month, and can add more at the same price as needed.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Seedbox Server.</strong>
        A dedicated seedbox from <a href="https://pulsedmedia.com/clients/aff.php?aff=1275" target="_blank">Pulsed Media
          (affiliate link)</a> costs 75€ per year.
        Please see the <a href="/user.php?id=28">seedbox user account stats</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Domain Name.</strong>
        The site domain name costs $15 per year. The SSL certificate is gratis.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Parent Company.</strong>
        Because I'm handling personal information such as email and IP addresses, and soliciting donations from the
        public, legal protection is prudent.
        An LLC is forthcoming and not expected to exceed $75 per year.
