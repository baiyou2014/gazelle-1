    <strong>No personally identifying patient data is allowed anywhere on the site.</strong>

  <li>
    Staff can do anything to anyone for any reason (or no reason).

    <strong>Please use the
      <strong class="important_text_alt">vanity.house</strong>
      tag for data you or your lab produced.</strong>
    This helps us promote the DIYbio community's original contributions.
  </li>

  <li>
    Tags should be comma-separated, and you should use a period to separate words inside a tag, e.g.,
    <strong class="important_text_alt">gram.negative</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    There is a list of official tags <?=($OnUpload ? 'to the left of the text box' : 'on the <a href="upload.php">upload page</a>')?>.
    Please use these tags instead of "unofficial" tags, e.g., use the official
    <strong class="important_text_alt">fungi</strong>
    tag instead of an unofficial
    <strong class="important_text">mushrooms</strong>
    tag.
  </li>

  <li>Avoid using multiple synonymous tags.
    Using both
    <strong class="important_text">cyanobacteria</strong>
    and
    <strong class="important_text_alt">bacteria</strong>
    is redundant and stupid &mdash; just use the official
    <strong class="important_text_alt">bacteria</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Don't add useless tags that are already covered by other metadata.
    If a torrent is in the DNA category, please don't tag it
    <strong class="important_text">dna</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Only tag information related to the group itself &mdash;
    <strong>not the individual release</strong>.
    Tags such as
    <strong class="important_text">apollo.100</strong>,
    <strong class="important_text">hiseq.2500</strong>,
    etc., are strictly forbidden.
    Remember that these tags will be used for other releases in the same group.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Certain tags are strongly encouraged for appropriate uploads:</strong>
    <strong class="important_text_alt">archaea</strong>,
    <strong class="important_text_alt">bacteria</strong>,
    <strong class="important_text_alt">fungi</strong>,
    <strong class="important_text_alt">animals</strong>,
    <strong class="important_text_alt">plants</strong>,
    <strong class="important_text_alt">plasmids</strong>.
    People search for these kinds of things specifically, so tagging them properly will get you more snatches.
  </li>

  <!--
  <li>
    <strong>Use tag namespaces when appropriate.</strong>
    BioTorrents.de allows for tag namespaces to aid with searching.
    For example, you may want to use the tags
    <strong class="important_text_alt">masturbation:male</strong>
    or
    <strong class="important_text_alt">masturbation:female</strong>
    instead of just
    <strong class="important_text">masturbation</strong>.
    They can be used to make search queries more specific.
    Searching for
    <strong class="important_texti_alt">masturbation</strong>
    will show all torrents tagged with
    <strong class="important_text_alt">masturbation</strong>,
    <strong class="important_text_alt">masturbation:male</strong>,
    or
    <strong class="important_text_alt">masturbation:female</strong>.
    However, searching for
    <strong class="important_text_alt">masturbation:female</strong>
    will <strong>only</strong> show torrents with that tag.
    Tags with namespaces will appear differently depending on the namespace used, which include:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>:parody</strong> - Used to denote a parodied work:
        <strong class="tag_parody">touhou</strong>,
        <strong class="tag_parody">kantai.collection</strong>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>:character</strong> - Used to denote a character in a parodied work:
        <strong class="tag_character">iori.minase</strong>,
        <strong class="tag_character">hakurei.reimu</strong>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>:male</strong> - Used to denote that the tag refers to a male character:
        <strong class="tag_male">masturbation</strong>,
        <strong class="tag_male">teacher</strong>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>:female</strong> - Used to denote that the tag refers to a female character:
        <strong class="tag_female">masturbation</strong>,
        <strong class="tag_female">shaved</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  -->

  <li>
    <strong>All uploads require a minimum of 5 tags.</strong>
    Please don't add unrelated tags just to meet the 5 tag requirement.
    If you can't think of 5 tags for your content, study it again until you can.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>You should be able to build up a list of tags using only the official tags
      <?=($OnUpload ? 'to the left of the text box' : 'on the <a href="upload.php">upload page</a>')?>.</strong>
    If you doubt whether or not a tag is acceptable, please omit it for now and send a staff PM to request a new
    official tag or an approved alias.

    Let's treat the biology boards like how the Shroomery used to be:
    each thread a set of resourceful wisdom worth using permalinks to.
    It's okay if the boards are slow, that's why there are only a few of them.
  </li>

  <li>
    Please discuss site news in the corresponding Announcements thread instead of making a new General thread.
    Discussing science-related news in General is highly encouraged, but discussing political news is much less so.
    But don't self-censor, e.g., you can discuss the political and economic factors of the 2019-nCoV outbreak,
    but you can't start a thread about trade deals and hope to steer it toward biology.
    Thank you.
  </li>

  <li>
    No advertising, referrals, affiliate links, cryptocurrency pumps, or calls to action that involve using a financial
    instrument.
    You'll be banned on the spot.
    The exceptions: discussions about cryptocurrencies that derive their value from work performed on distributed
    science networks, i.e., Curecoin, FoldingCoin, and Gridcoin.
  </li>

  <li>
    Feel free to post announcements for your own projects, even and especially if they're commercial ones, in the
    General board.
    Limit all discussion of trading biomaterials, including bulk giveaways, to the Marketplace forum available to Power
    Users.
  </li>

  <li>
    Please be modest when talking about your uploads.
    It's unnecessary to announce your uploads because Gazelle logs everything
    (at least this installation's database is encrypted).
    If someone asks for help on his project and your upload fits the bill, go write a post!
  </li>

  <li>
    Use descriptive and specific subject lines.
    This helps others decide whether your particular words of "wisdom" relate to a topic they care about.
  </li>

  <li>
    Don't post comments that don't add anything to the discussion, such as "I agree" or "haha."
    Bottle the trained dopamine response to social media because comment reactions are an unlikely feature.
  </li>

  <li>
    Please refrain from quoting excessively.
    When quoting someone, use only the necessary parts of the quote.
    Avoid quoting more than 3 levels deep.
  </li>

  <li>
    Don't post potentially malicious links without sufficient warning, or post pictures > 2 MiB.
    Please only speak English as stated in the upload rules.
  </li>

  <?=SITE_NAME?>'s Slack channels are just are another quiet hangout
  you can stack your app with so you look cool at conferences.
</li>

<li>
  Please use
  <code>#general</code> for the usual chit-chat,
  <code>#development</code> for questions about the Gazelle software, and
  <code>#support</code> to get help with your account.
</li>

<li>
  Don't send mass alerts with
  <code>@channel</code>,
  <code>@everyone</code>, or
  <code>@here</code>.
  It's obnoxious and you should handle anything genuinely important on the boards.
</li>

<li>
  Flooding is irritating and you'll get kicked for it.
  This includes "now playing" scripts, large amounts of irrelevant text such as lorem ipsum, and unfunny non sequiturs.
</li>

<li>
  Impersonating other members, particularly staff members, will not go unpunished.
  Please remember that the Slack channels are publicly accessible.
</li>

<li>
  Please use the threaded conversations feature in Slack and avoid replying to threads with new messages or crossposting
  replies to the main channel.
</li>

<li>
  Announce and bot channels are in development, as standard IRC instead of Slack for obvious reasons.
  Any IRC bots you have must authenticate with your own username and IRC key, and set the <code>+B</code> usermode on
  themselves.
